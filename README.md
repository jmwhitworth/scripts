# scripts
My personal dev scripts I use alongside Zsh

Run setup.sh to get started. This creates an alias in ~/.zshrc for the bootstrap file, and grants executable permissions to all .sh files.

Note that if you move the directory after running setup, the alias in ~/.zshrc will need to be updated.


```bash
sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh
```

```bash
./setup.sh
```
